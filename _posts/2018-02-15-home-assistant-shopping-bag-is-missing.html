<div class="info">Well, they've updated the supervisor in Hass.io and the shopping bag is gone, the functionality has been moved inside the Hass.io menu. This post has been updated accordingly. </div> So, you've installed Home Assistant and are working through the <A HREF="https://home-assistant.io/getting-started/">getting started</A> guide, when you run into a problem.  <P>The Hass.io menu is missing, there's no way of getting to the add-on store. You can't install any add-ons, but the guide says you should be able to.  <P>Well, the answer is that the getting started guide is <strong>very heavily focused</strong> on Hass.io as an install method, and you used another install method for Home Assistant.  <H2>Hass.io</H2> <P>Hass.io is just a way of <A HREF="https://home-assistant.io/docs/installation/">installing Home Assistant</A>, one that is based on ResinOS. It brings some extra features (I'll touch on those in a moment) and it also introduces some challenges.  <P>Not all components work as expected on Hass.io, since the <em>container</em> that Home Assistant runs in (which is not the container you connect to when you SSH to the host) is stripped down. Almost everything works, but some wont - and most of those are marked in the documentation.  <H2>Don't panic!</H2> <P>You're missing two things:  <UL><LI>Snapshots <LI>Add-ons </UL> <P>Snapshots are just local backups. I've <A HREF="/2017/10/backing-up-home-assistant.html">previously covered backups</A> - and off host backups are <em>far</em> better than on-host backups. Add-ons are intended as an easy way of installing a package, designed to make it less complicated. They do nothing you can't do manually yourself, though you may need to read some fine documentation.  <H2>Remember where <strike>we parked</strike> you are</H2> <P>Any time you're looking at Home Assistant documentation under <kbd>/hassio</kbd> or <kbd>/addons</kbd>, or see a reference to the three dots menu, or the add-ons - these are Hass.io specific. If you didn't install Hass.io then those things won't work for you.  <P>That's not a problem, it's just a thing to keep in mind. There's no right, or wrong, way to install Home Assistant - just choices to make that then shape how you'll approach things.
