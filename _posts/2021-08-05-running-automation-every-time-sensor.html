<p>&nbsp;A common question on the HA Discord is how to have an automation run any time a sensor updates. The answer is both simple (it's covered in the official documentation), and not (because there's traps).</p><p>Here I'll quickly cover how to have that work the way you expect it.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Trigger</h2><div>A simple <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/trigger/#state-trigger" target="_blank">state trigger</a> is what you need. You don't need a <kbd>to</kbd> or a <kbd>from</kbd>, just two lines:</div><pre>trigger:<br />- platform: state<br />  entity_id: sensor.your_sensor<br /></pre>As explained in the documentation, this will trigger when the state <i>or any attribute</i>&nbsp;changes. If your sensor/switch/light/whatever has attributes that update, like say the battery level, or the signal strength, or something else then the automation will run, despite the state not having changed.<div><br /></div><div>This causes a lot of surprises and confusion.<br /><div><br /></div><div>That's ok though, we can fix that with a...</div><h2 style="text-align: left;">Condition</h2><div>We can use a <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/scripts/conditions/#template-condition" target="_blank">template condition</a>, using the <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/state_object/" target="_blank">state objects</a> from the <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/templating/#state" target="_blank">state trigger template</a>. This allows us to compare the previous and new state and see if they're different:</div><pre>condition:<br />- condition: template<br />  value_template: "{{ "{{" }} trigger.from_state.state != trigger.to_state.state }}"<br /></pre>Now the automation won't continue if the current and previous state are the same.</div><h2 style="text-align: left;"><span>Together</span></h2><div><span>Now we can bring that together:</span></div><pre>trigger:<br />- platform: state<br />  entity_id: sensor.your_sensor<br />condition:<br />- condition: template<br />  value_template: "{{ "{{" }} trigger.from_state.state != trigger.to_state.state }}"<br /></pre>Just add your action and anything else handy, like and <kbd>alias</kbd>, and an <kbd>id</kbd> so you can use the trace feature.
