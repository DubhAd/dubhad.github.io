Today I finally upgraded from 0.75.3 to one of the versions with the new auth, 0.80.0 in this case. I'd delayed the upgrade because I expected some challenges with the new authentication interacting with my NGINX setup. Before I began, I checked the backups, cloned the venv and took a snapshot of the config directory. That way if anything went wrong I could be back up and running in a few minutes.<br /><h3>Timeline</h3>00:00 - Stop Home Assistant<br />00:02 - Home Assistant finally stops<br />00:03 - Upgrade command issued<br />00:14 - Upgrade command finishes<br /><br />00:14 - Start Home Assistant<br />00:17 - Database upgrade starts<br />00:17 - Database upgrade completes, the advantage of only keeping a few days of data (135 MB)<br />00:20 - Upgrade of OZW starts, long compile delay ahead<br />00:30 - Upgrade of OZW completes, but numpy starts now<br />00:44 - Upgrade of numpy completes<br />00:47 - Home Assistant finishes the first nmap scan and takes a nap<br />00:49 - Home Assistant wakes up from the nap and finishes startup, just OZW to go<br />00:50 - It comes as no shock that OZW crashes Home Assistant on startup, a problem with the cache file it created<br /><br />00:52 - Having restored a known good backup of the cache, Home Assistant is started again<br />00:52 - After the nmap scan, Home Assistant naps again<br />00:54 - Home Assistant wakes and finishes the startup, just OZW to go again<br />00:56 - OZW behaved this time, the mesh is set up<br />00:58 - Set up a user for the proxy server<br />00:59 - NGINX updated to insert the Bearer token and restarted<br />01:00 - And we're done<br /><h3>Why the long time</h3>What took so long? Well, there's two things at the heart of this (three if you include OpenZWave crashing Home Assistant):<br /><br /><ol><li>I'm running Python 3.6, not Python 3.5 that Home Assistant is developed on and is supported by PiWheels. That means I need to compile packages, which on a Pi is sloooooooow.</li><li>The I/O bandwidth on the Pi for the SD card is low</li></ol><div>If I'd been on Python 3.5 then we'd have saved at least 24 minutes out of that, likely more. If I'd been running on a USB connected SSD then more time would have been saved. This though is pretty much a worst case upgrade time, so a useful benchmark for others.</div>
