I've already talked in general about <a href="https://sgrudadh.blogspot.co.uk/2017/10/backup-up-home-assistant.html">backing up Home Assistant</a>, but for Hass.io the process is slightly different.<br /><br />The problem is that there's no easy access to local USB drives, and the stock SSH add-on doesn't have rsync. The solution comes in the form of an <a href="https://github.com/hassio-addons/repository">upgraded SSH add-on</a> from frenck.<br /><br />If you've installed the stock add-on, remove it before installing frenck's - or install frenck's and configure it to use a different port. Having done that, follow the original guide to <a href="https://sgrudadh.blogspot.co.uk/2017/10/backup-up-home-assistant.html?view=classic">using a remote computer</a>.<br /><br />Unfortunately, yes, you'll need to use a remote system to back it up. At this point there's no way around that, but I'm fairly confident that if you watch <a href="https://github.com/hassio-addons/repository">frenck's repository</a> that'll change.
