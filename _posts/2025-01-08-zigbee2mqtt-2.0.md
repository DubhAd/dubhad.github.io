I've seen a few people struggle with the deprecation of `_click` and `_action` entities for Home Assistant.

These have been replaced with new (for Zigbee2MQTT) `event` entities, which behave differently enough to be confusing at first.

## Summary

* `event` entities have a state that is the time they last fired, so you have to use the _State_ trigger for them, selecting _To (optional)_ as _Any state (ignoring attribute changes)_
* You then have to parse the [new state object](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/state_object) with [templates](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/templating/) to identify what happened
* Not all devices behave exactly the same, you'll need to use [developer tools](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/developer_states/) to look at the attributes of your `event` entity to see what you need.

You _could_ use device triggers, but they only work in the UI, and suffer from so many limitations that I can't recommend them.

## Worked example

I had an [automation for the office dial](https://github.com/DubhAd/Home-AssistantConfig/blob/76c16e92873549baae6e511a11b757810c1f596f/automation/office/office_dial.yaml) to pause/play the music when the dial was clicked. I've simplified it for this example:

```yaml
id: 'office_dial_action'
alias: 'Office dial action'
triggers:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.office_dial_moes_action
    to: 'toggle'
actions:
  - if:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: media_player.office
        state: 'playing'
    then:
      - action: media_player.media_pause
        data:
          entity_id: media_player.office
    else:
      - action: media_player.media_play
        data:
          entity_id: media_player.office
```

Now it looks [like this](https://github.com/DubhAd/Home-AssistantConfig/blob/live/automation/office/office_dial.yaml):

{% raw %}
```yaml
id: 'office_dial_action'
alias: 'Office dial action'
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: event.office_dial_moes_action
    to: ~
conditions:
  - condition: template
    value_template: >-
      {{ trigger.to_state.attributes.event_type == 'toggle' }}
actions:
  - if:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: media_player.office
        state: 'playing'
    then:
      - action: media_player.media_pause
        data:
          entity_id: media_player.office
    else:
      - action: media_player.media_play
        data:
          entity_id: media_player.office
```
{% endraw %}

That's not _very_ different, and the actions are exactly the same, so how did I get there?

### Step by step

1. First thing I did was open [my devices page](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/devices/) and find the device. 
2. Then I found the `event` entity, in the _Events_ box - in this case everything I need to know is actually shown there. It tells me that when I click the dial the _Action_ is `toggle`. 
3. For other devices you may need more than just the action, and that's where [developer tools](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/developer_states/) comes in. Go there and filter down to the event entity. 
4. In the _Attributes_ column you'll see (at least) two relevant attributes. These are `event_type` and `event_types` - the first being the last event, and the other being a list of possible values. My mmWave sensor also has another relevant attribute - `region` - that identifies the detection region the event took place in.

The main change here is to the trigger, and then adding a template condition to filter out the event I'm interested in.

### Details

```yaml
triggers:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.office_dial_moes_action
    to: 'toggle'
        # move this value to a new template condition, replacing the value with null (no quotes)
```
becomes
{% raw %}
```yaml
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: event.office_dial_moes_action
    to: ~
        # null and ~ (and NULL) are functionally identical - I just happen to prefer ~
conditions:
  - condition: template
    value_template: >-
      {{ trigger.to_state.attributes.event_type == 'toggle' }}
```
{% endraw %}

For _almost_ everything I had they followed this format and approach:
1. Swap the entity in the trigger from `sensor.*_action` to the `event.` entity
2. Change the `to:` to be on [any state change](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/trigger/#state-trigger)
3. Add a template condition checking that the event type (of the new state) is the state value you had before

The exceptions were one automation where either I had a typo or there was some tidy-up done in Zigbee2MQTT that changed `-` to `_` as used by everything else, and one where additional attributes were involved.

### Other examples

Some things took a little more effort, like the [template sensor](https://github.com/DubhAd/Home-AssistantConfig/blob/88e4f888a6b6947589f7f4c0fd0fea7201238f87/template/office/office_mmwave_region_1.yaml) for the [office mmWave sensor](https://github.com/DubhAd/Home-AssistantConfig/blob/live/template/office/office_mmwave_region_1.yaml), though some actually got simplified. For instance my [volume control](https://github.com/DubhAd/Home-AssistantConfig/blob/76c16e92873549baae6e511a11b757810c1f596f/automation/office/office_dial_rotate.yaml) automation [became](https://github.com/DubhAd/Home-AssistantConfig/blob/live/automation/office/office_dial_rotate.yaml) shorter (and could actually be made shorter again).

## Conclusion - Don't Panic!

Yes, the switch away from the old entities seems daunting, particularly if you've never touched templates before.

Thankfully the details of the change are, mostly, really simple. The steps in [details](#details) are typically all that simple automations need - moving the value from the `to` to the template.

### PS: Illuminance lux

For those of you worried about the removal of the `lux` sensors - it's actually the raw value of the illuminance that's gone away, the lux value remains, it's just that the `illuminance` sensor is now the old `illuminance_lux` sensor. Yes, it's confusing, but as long as you didn't want the raw value you've not lost anything.
