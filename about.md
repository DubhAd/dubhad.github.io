# About this blog

A bunch of time was spent throwing letters randomly at the screen until they stuck to make these articles. I may also have tried the same approach in [the forum][forum] and [Discord server][channels], but it doesn't seem to work so well there.

A few folks have asked to buy me a beer by way of thanks. Sadly beer and technical work don't mix so well, but I won't say no if you want to [buy me a coffee][coffee] (though I may use it for tea, be warned).
