        <title>YAML sections</title>
        <description>
          
          NB: I’ve added this here as the knowledge has been removed from the official documentation. For some integrations every entity needs its own entry in the configuration.yaml file. There are two styles for multiple entity entries, and these apply regardless of the domain (sensor, binary_sensor, switch, etc) - that my...

        <title>Smart home or home automation</title>
        <description>
          
          We often talk about the smart home and home automation as if those terms are interchangeable, but they’re (mostly) not. Smart Home This is a house that contains devices that you can interact with, and potentially can interact with each other. These are things like the Hue lights, a Nest...

          If you’re reading this you’re looking at the new home of my blog. I’m moving off of Blogger and over to Jekyll, possibly on GitHub pages possibly on Cloudflare pages. As part of the migration I’m going through and fixing broken links in old posts and adding notes where information...

        <description>
          
          I’ve been playing with Traefik lately, for remote access for various things in my Docker stack, and I decided to see if it was possible to also use it for Home Assistant, despite that being on a remote host. The answer is (otherwise I wouldn’t havewritten this) yes - and...

          As you may remember, I use MotionEye and Doods, along withsome crazy scripting, to do motion and object detection at the front of the house. Well, used would be more accurate. Recently I tried out Frigate, initially without a Coral stick/board. The following day I turned off MotionEye and Doods. With...

           I see a lot of people confused by the four install options for Home Assistant. The first, and most important, thing to realise is that Home Assistant is the same no matter how you install it. The only thing that changes is how you install other software, and how you...

        <title>Zigbee2MQTT - Native to Docker migration</title>
        <description>
          
           A long time ago I started using Zigbee2MQTT - somewhere around 1.2 or 1.3. Back then I thought that it was easiest to run Zigbee2MQTT with a manual install, which was (and still is) the default instructions you’ll find. Since then I’ve seen the light. Docker makes upgrades, and downgrades,...

          I see many people struggle with the formatting for automations (and scripts) because the official docs are structured in a manner that assumes you’re going to read them in order. So, I thought I’d pull together a little primer. If you’re a YAML purist you probably want to look away...
