        <title>Welcome to Home Assistant</title>
        <description>
          
          You’ve installed Home Assistant, looked at the wall of documents, viewed a few (horribly out of date) YouTube videos, and are overwhelmed. Where do you begin? What do you need to know? In the beginning Home Assistant is an event system - things happen, and those generate events. If a...

        <title>Blog migration (2022)</title>
        <description>
          
          If you’re reading this you’re looking at the new home of my blog. I’m moving off of Blogger and over to Jekyll, possibly on GitHub pages possibly on Cloudflare pages. As part of the migration I’m going through and fixing broken links in old posts and adding notes where information...

        <title>Traefik and a remote Home Assistant</title>
        <description>
          
          I’ve been playing with Traefik lately, for remote access for various things in my Docker stack, and I decided to see if it was possible to also use it for Home Assistant, despite that being on a remote host. The answer is (otherwise I wouldn’t havewritten this) yes - and...

        <description>
          
          As you may remember, I use MotionEye and Doods, along withsome crazy scripting, to do motion and object detection at the front of the house. Well, used would be more accurate. Recently I tried out Frigate, initially without a Coral stick/board. The following day I turned off MotionEye and Doods. With...

        <title>How should I install Home Assistant?</title>
        <description>
          
           I see a lot of people confused by the four install options for Home Assistant. The first, and most important, thing to realise is that Home Assistant is the same no matter how you install it. The only thing that changes is how you install other software, and how you...

        <title>Zigbee2MQTT - Native to Docker migration</title>
        <description>
          
           A long time ago I started using Zigbee2MQTT - somewhere around 1.2 or 1.3. Back then I thought that it was easiest to run Zigbee2MQTT with a manual install, which was (and still is) the default instructions you’ll find. Since then I’ve seen the light. Docker makes upgrades, and downgrades,...

          Another year, another Python deprecation, another flood of posts asking how to upgrade a Python venv.  While you can certainly do that, another option would be to move to Docker (at least assuming you’re running on Linux). Then you don’t have to do this next year. Moving to Docker is...

          I see many people struggle with the formatting for automations (and scripts) because the official docs are structured in a manner that assumes you’re going to read them in order. So, I thought I’d pull together a little primer. If you’re a YAML purist you probably want to look away...

What is Zigbee Zigbee is a wireless communication protocol designed for personal area networks and well suited to home automation....

          Back when I started with home automation, Z-Wave was the obvious choice for sensors, smart sockets. You could mix and match any brand of device, and controller, and things would work. Zigbee was more of a minefield at the time. The universe has moved on, and Zigbee is becoming more...
