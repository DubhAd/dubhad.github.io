        <p>Back when I started with home automation, Z-Wave was the obvious choice for sensors, smart sockets. You could mix and match any brand of device, and controller, and things would work. Zigbee was more of a minefield at the time.</p>

<p>The universe has moved on, and Zigbee is becoming more of a standard. Home Assistant now has two core Zigbee integrations with a wide range of supported devices (<a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha">zha</a> and <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/deconz/">deconz</a>), and then there’s <a href="https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/">zigbee2mqtt</a>.</p>

<p>I’d already stepped into Zigbee when I bought a Hue hub and compatible light strip controller, but hadn’t intended to do much more than use the hub as a gateway for some lights. I had nothing but trouble with the hub though. It would regularly go <em>unavailable</em> for tens of minutes, so I accepted the prompt for a firmware upgrade, at the end of which the hub wouldn’t respond to the Hue app. Nothing I did would bring it back to life, and given the previous trouble I’d had with it I decided it was time to jump fully in.</p>

<h3 id="which-path">Which path?</h3>

<p>There’s no right answer here, they each have advantages, disadvantages, and slightly different device support. Of course, with all of them you can add unsupported devices and help create support for them.</p>

<p>I went with Zigbee2MQTT for two main reasons</p>

<ol>
  <li>I’m now using MQTT anyway for <a href="https://github.com/andrewjfreyer/monitor">monitor</a></li>
  <li>I want something that I can upgrade and change separately from HA, to cut down on restarts</li>
</ol>

<p>All I needed to get started was to ditch that Hue hub, and buy all the parts needed to build a stick and a router. That takes too long to ship from the other side of the world, so while I did order the parts for flashing firmware, I ordered a <a href="http://zigbee2mqtt.discourse.group/t/ad-buy-ready2use-zigbee2mqtt-stick-flashed-antenna-mod-and-printed-case/22">pre-assembled controller and router</a>. Those came with antenna soldered on, and a nice case.</p>

<p><strong><em>NB: I wouldn’t recommend this stick any more, the CC253x chips have significant limitations, buy something CC2652 based</em></strong></p>

<h3 id="and-so-it-begins">And so, it begins</h3>

<p>Getting the Gledopto reset was a pain, but after a few dozen attempts, it worked. Because I worked on that over a few evenings, I had the time to order a small stack of Xiaomi devices - a bunch of door/window sensors, a <em>human body sensor</em> (motion and light levels), and a temperature and humidity sensor. Those almost all worked as I hoped. The door/window sensors are fantastic, and the temperature and humidity sensor works well. The motion and light sensor… is a good motion sensor, but it only reports light levels when there’s motion (and it’s not terribly sensitive at lower light levels). I’ve clearly been spoiled by the Z-Wave multi-sensors. Still, they have their uses.</p>

<p>Still, I ordered a batch more of the door/window sensors, a couple more temperature and humidity sensors, and one of the <em>wireless switch</em> units - a little battery powered button.</p>

<p>I’ve also started replacing some of the accent lighting with adjustable colour temperature units, which makes a rather pleasant change.</p>

<h3 id="going-forwards">Going forwards</h3>

<p>I’m likely to stay with both, at least for the next few years. Neither of these are without issues - Z-Wave is relatively expensive, and Zigbee has (for me at least) been slightly less reliable - one device for instance left the mesh when it was power cycled, and refuses to re-join.</p>
