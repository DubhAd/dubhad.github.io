<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Talk about my hardware choices, and why. Things I've learned based on my and other people's experience.</p><p>For sensors, I'd stick light and temperature sensors in every room, and motion sensors (or other presence detection) either side of most doorways (so you can work out direction of travel). Every door or window - internal too - would have a door sensor, and any room able to generate humidity (bathrooms, kitchen, etc) would have a humidity sensor</p><p>Leak sensors, gas sensors, smoke/heat sensors</p>
