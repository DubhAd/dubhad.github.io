Automations are really very simple, unless you're new to them, in which case they're a massive confusing ball of YAML (like string, except more likely to tangle and cause frustration).<div><br /></div><div>I'm going to explain the very basics of automations here.</div><h2 style="text-align: left;">What?</h2><div>Yeah, you're right, I should start with <i>what is an automation and why would I want one?</i>&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>An automation is how you get Home Assistant to <i>do</i>&nbsp;things when something happens. That something might be a time, or device in your home doing something, or anything else that HA can detect.</div><div><br /></div><div>It's very much WTDT - <i>When This, Do That</i>.</div><div><br /></div><div>A close relative of automations are scripts. The main difference is that scripts have to be called by something else (such as an automation).</div><h2 style="text-align: left;">Entities</h2><div>Before we go on to automations, I should touch on the automation relevant parts of entities.</div><h2 style="text-align: left;">State</h2><div>Automations have to be on (enabled) to run. If you turn an automation off you disable it, and it won't run.</div><div><br /></div><div>This can be useful once you're doing some more complex logic, but for now just remember that if your automation doesn't run, check that it's turned on.</div><div><br /></div><div>Let's start building the automation, as if it was going in automations.yaml:</div><div></div><pre>- initial_state: on</pre> <h2 style="text-align: left;">About the automation</h2><div>All automations should have an alias - the friendly name for you so you remember what it does. If your automation doesn't have an id (see below) then the alias is used to create the entity_id of the automation.</div><div><br /></div><div>The UI editor needs a unique id. The editor itself uses the Unix timestamp format, but you can use anything you want, as long as it only contains <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/#entity-names" target="_blank">valid characters</a>. In short, that's lower case (ASCII) letters, numbers, and the underscore.</div><div><br /></div><div>If you want to force an automation to be enabled or disabled on startup (or when you reload automations) regardless of their previous state, you can set the initial_state.</div><div><br /></div><div>You can also add a description here, if you want more details than the alias can provide.</div><div><br /></div><div>Let's add to our automation</div><pre>- initial_state: on<br />  alias: "My first automation"<br />  id: my_first_automation<br />  description: The very first automation I wrote</pre> <h2 style="text-align: left;">Trigger</h2><div>Now we're getting to the useful bits. Triggers are what starts an automation:</div><div><br /></div><div><b><i>When any of these becomes true</i></b></div><div><b><i><br /></i></b></div><div>If you have five different triggers, then any of them <i>becoming</i>&nbsp;true (firing) will start the automation. If that trigger remains true it won't cause the automation to run again.</div><div><br /></div><div>There are many different trigger types, but the ones that are most commonly used are probably state, and numeric state.</div><h3 style="text-align: left;">State</h3><div>A state trigger fires when the entities state changes, or the state of a specified attribute. You can require it to change to, or from, a particular value, and you can require it to have changed to that value for a given amount of time.&nbsp;</div> <h2 style="text-align: left;">Condition (optional)</h2> <h2 style="text-align: left;">Action</h2> <h2 style="text-align: left;">Mode</h2>
