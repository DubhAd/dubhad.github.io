You've installed Home Assistant, looked at the wall of documents, viewed a few (horribly out of date) YouTube videos, and are overwhelmed.<br /><br />Where do you begin? What do you need to know?<br /><h3>In the beginning</h3>Home Assistant is an <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/events/">event system</a> - things happen, and those generate events. If a sensor reads a new value, that's an event. The time changes, that's an event. Of course, that's all well and good for what <i>is happening</i>, not what has&nbsp;happened. For that, Home Assistant uses <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/state_object/">state objects</a>, and those state objects are associated with an entity. Those entities are unique (so there can only be one called <kbd>sensor.flood</kbd>), and are used in your automations, scripts, scenes, etc.<br /><br />So what?<br /><br />Well, when you're writing <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/">that automation</a>, triggers fire based off of events (though you can use states to check the previous value too), and conditions use states. Triggers are for <i>this just happened</i>&nbsp;and conditions for <i>this is currently true</i>.<br /><br />This is why triggers are <i>always</i> <kbd>or</kbd> statements - only one trigger has to be true. Conditions can be either <kbd>and</kbd> statements or <kbd>or</kbd> statements, because they're checking historical information.<br /><br />Keep that in mind as you <a href="https://blog.ceard.tech/2018/08/triggers-and-conditions-and-actions-oh.html">write your automations</a>.<br /><h3>Entities</h3><div>That entity (<kbd>sensor.flood</kbd>) we mentioned consists of two parts, the platform (<kbd>sensor</kbd>) and the name (<kbd>flood</kbd>). Sometimes you'll see the platform referred to as the domain.<br /><br />Entities are unique, and entities are normally lower case. If you define a sensor that you think will be <kbd>sensor.Front_door</kbd> then instead you'll find it as <kbd>sensor.front_door</kbd>. It's that entity ID that you'll use in automations, and templates, and everywhere else.<br /><br />You can also give entities a <i>friendly name</i>&nbsp;for the UI. That's just for your convenience and you can call every entity in your system <i>Fred</i>&nbsp;should you want to.</div><h3>Configuration file format</h3><div>The <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/">configuration</a> file uses <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/yaml/">YAML</a>. YAML can be <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/">hard to learn</a> at first, but it's basically really a really simple format:</div><div><pre>header: # This is a comment<br />  sub: # This entity will be header.sub<br />    key: value<br />    other: list, of, values<br />    another:<br />      - list<br />      - of<br />      - values<br />  sub2: # This entity will be header.sub2<br />    key: value</pre></div>or:<br /><div><pre>header2:<br />  - name: myThing # This entity will be header2.mything<br />    key: value<br />    other: list, of, values<br />    another:<br />      - list<br />      - of<br />      - values<br />  - name: other_thing # This entity will be header2.other_thing<br />    key: value2<br />    other: list, of, values<br />    word: another</pre></div>The first is the format used by <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/components/alert/">alert</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/components/group/">group</a>, <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/components/input_boolean/">input_boolean</a>, <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/components/input_select/">input_select</a>, <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/components/input_text/">input_text</a>, <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/components/input_number/">input_number</a>, <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/components/input_datetime/">input_datetime</a>, and <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/components/intent_script/">intents</a>&nbsp;(and probably a few others I've forgotten). The other is used by most things, like <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/">automations</a>, <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/components/sensor/">sensors</a>, etc etc.<br /><br />Any header must only appear once. You can't have two <kbd>sensor:</kbd> lines (outside of packages). If you really want more then you have to add something to make it unique - for example the second might be <kbd>sensor two:</kbd> or <kbd>sensor front_door:</kbd>. The thing you add doesn't matter, it's not used anywhere, it just has to be unique.<br /><br />The only other important thing to know is how to indent. Don't use the tab key, and be consistent with the number of spaces you use per indent. Two spaces per indent level are the standard advised, but if you want to use three, or four, or one, that's up to you. The problem of course is that it makes it much harder to include other's work if you don't use two.<br /><h3>Expanding the capabilities</h3><div><a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/components/">Components</a>&nbsp;are where the flexibility, and complexity, of Home Assistant arrives. At the time I wrote this there were 39 sections, containing 1,146 components, plus a whole host of unofficial custom components.<br /><br />Components belong to a platform. Those platforms are things like <kbd>switch</kbd>, or <kbd>sensor</kbd>, or <kbd>device_tracker</kbd>. You add the component under a header for that platform, and the entities created will start with that platform. There are a few (those in the <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/components/#other">other category</a>) are their own platform.<br /><br />For example, here's the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/components/sensor.random/">random</a>&nbsp;component&nbsp;for the <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/components/sensor/">sensor</a> platform:<br /><pre>sensor:<br />  - platform: random<br />    name: rainbow</pre>Now we'll have an entity called <kbd>sensor.rainbow</kbd> that we can use in automations. If we want another random sensor, we'll need to give it another name (or let the system handle it for us).<br /><br />Custom components have one problem though. They're not always updated to account for the changes in Home Assistant, so sometimes you'll upgrade Home Assistant and then things go wrong. If that happens to you, disable any custom components and see if that fixes your problems.</div>
