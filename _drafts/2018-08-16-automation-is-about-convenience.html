While working on home automation, it's easy to get used to the things it does for you.<br /><br />We were visiting a neighbour the other day, and they had various lights for accent and background lighting. It was very effective, but after we left my wife uttered the fateful words <i>I couldn't be bothered with all the trouble</i>.<br /><h3>The easy life?</h3>I looked at her, and asked what she meant. It turns out that for all grumbling I get about the lighting automations around the house, she loves it - even if it took being reminded of the pain it was before. More to the point, she's become so used to it, that the thought of manually turning on and off a scattering of lights made her wince.<br /><br />It's only been a year since I started experimenting with automation, but it's slowly become forgotten about (when I've not broken things anyway). This ultimately is the goal of good automation - people stop paying attention to the person behind the curtain.<br /><h3>So what?</h3>Well, a year ago, my wife thought I was crazy with this home automation stuff. Six months ago she put up with it, and complained a lot that the automations didn't work <i>right</i>.<br /><br />Now? Now automation is no longer a rude word, but an accepted part of life. Adding some voice control (courtesy of <a href="https://store.google.com/product/google_home_mini">Google Home Mini</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/google_assistant/">Google Assistant component</a>) really helped.<br /><br />Getting the automations to behave the way we wanted hasn't been easy. I've learned a lot of the last year about Home Assistant, automations, and us.
