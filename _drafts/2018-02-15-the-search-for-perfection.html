Chat in discord  Valid point that all comms should be encrypted  Pragmatic perspective that this can't always be the case - skills, accessibility, embedded systems, etc  Other person said: Not everything should be docker run kinda abstract.

And that comes especially true on security.  Point that this isn't about the tech community - this is about normal people
