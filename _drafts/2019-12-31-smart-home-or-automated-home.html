We often talk about the smart home and home automation as if those terms are interchangeable, but they're not, though they overlap.<br /><h3>Smart Home</h3><div>This is a house that contains devices that you can interact with, and potentially can interact with each other. These are things like the Hue lights, that Nest thermostat, Ring doorbell, smart lock, and more.</div><div><br /></div><div>Individually, each of these things is useful, but it's really been the addition of voice assistants that have taken it from a toy to something useful. Now you don't have to find your phone, open an app, and then take control from there. Instead you just say <i>Alexa, turn on the lights</i>&nbsp;or <i>Hey Google, lock the front door</i>.</div><div><br /></div><div>The power of this is extended by things like routines, and other smart home features that allow you to do more than one thing, or turn on lights automatically at sunset (where it starts to blend into low end home automation).</div><div><br /></div><div>Talking of that...</div><h3>Home Automation</h3><div>This is where you take your smart home, and add some (limited) brains to it. You start linking things together, saying <i>if this happens, do that</i>.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Doing this builds upon the foundation of a smart home - it adds a system to run that brains, sensors to detect things happening, and potentially connection to external services for other data.</div><div><br /></div><div>Some of the automations may be very simple - like turning on the outside lights when the sun sets, then turning them off when the sun rises. Some may be more complicated - like turning on certain lights only if you're home, and watching the TV.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Having automation doesn't stop you from taking manual control, though depending on your system you may need to ensure you allow for that, so that it doesn't fight you.</div><h3>Not competing</h3><div>These aren't competing things, they fit on a spectrum. At one end you have a traditional "dumb" house that everybody understands. At the other end you have a fully automated house, and somewhere between the two you have smart houses.</div><div><br /></div><div>Some people want, and can afford, a fully automated house. Others (probably the majority) just want something simple and predictable, where you can just replace a bulb without any extra steps. The rest of us fit somewhere on the range between a basic smart home (maybe just a voice assistant) and a, relatively speaking, limited automated home.</div>
